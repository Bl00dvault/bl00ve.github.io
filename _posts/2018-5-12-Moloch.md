![Moloch](/images/Moloch.jpg "Edgar 'Moloch' Jacobi")

<br />
Just so happens that this tool I'm working with is also a villain in one of my favorite comics. So of course I'm going to make the
reference.  

As with everyday in the military my new task is to create dashboards for Moloch. Essentially creating a quickview that network analysts can
choose pre-built queries. There is options to save "views" in Moloch, however I see copy pasting the queries to load into the application 
everytime it's restarted as being too time consuming. I noticed that Moloch utilizes the URI whenever a query is input. The next logical
step is to write a script to generate URI's to pass to Moloch.

###The Problem  
The only difficult part is creating the "startTime" and "endTime" parameter since Moloch uses a really odd countdown feature. When 
startTime = 0, it displays the current time. But, when startTime = 1 the display is a date in 1969. Every subsequent number higher is 
based in seconds. Originally my thought was creating a script which calculated the time requested in seconds from the current time via:

>CurrentTime - InputTime = UriTime  

However, generating the number of seconds that could span across months seems pretty difficult, especially with varying number of days in
a month. Might need to take each month and generate a number of seconds and set benchmarks for each year, probably going back the last 5. 
I found it easiest to get those numbers via trial and error, but we'll see how it turns out.  

I'll post the script on my github. I'll probably call it "Find Jacobi" as a clever reference to The Watchmen.
