title: Docking is Gross
---

Since I'm starting the blogging trend, I figured I'd lay out one of the current issues I'm having. The task is to create training for
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) that is low level enough to get the concepts out of the way, since my coworkers will not need to 
engineer much content (mostly due to the nature of the tool). However, my dilemma is the tool can be very robust in the way you can 
implement containers as services, and even creating containers themselves. Also, working on a air gapped environment with the containers
and resources being heavily controlled/restricted it's difficult to find resources where people are referencing working with Docker 
offline. To restate, basically my issue is how in depth do you train to a broad audience and how can I create resources that can be 
useable in my environment.  

>Issue - Train to a broad audience with a topic, while not a deep topic, can be tailored quite a bit.  
>Issue - Develop a process to obtain resources offline for a tool that is designed to be interfaced with an Internet repo.  

To tackle the first issue, I'm now realizing that it makes sense to break up the training into two parts. The first part will be basic 
commands in Docker (such as the container administration commands) and what the terminology means. The second training piece will be
geared towards this process I'm figuring out now. How to identify the container you want, the dependencies it entails, and how to obtain 
these images from the web to our environment, or a central repository in our environment to locate them would be the main topics.  
I've worked on this for about a week now, and just writing out my thoughts was all I needed for a good way ahead. This bloggin thing will
probably happen more often. In summary:  

>Part 1 - Basic Docker commands/terminology  
>Part 2 - Identify the container relationships and dependencies, transferring containers from the web or other resources to our environment
, and how to create/add to a central repository for creating a truly modular experience.    

Now that I have a good roadmap there I guess I'll also mention I have started the 90 day labs for OSCP and it definitely seems like a ball
buster. A lot of my upcoming blog posts will probably be in relation to that. Before I forget, I spent my first day of "Passive Information
Gathering" on the leagueoflegends.com domain since the guides have you practice on the internet and the results are pretty neat. Thankfully,
I didn't actually find anything that useful, except for a way to find ISP information in relation to League at 
[LagReport](https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/) and a [XSS error](http://xssed.com/mirror/69241) that was reported on a website 
as not fixed since 2011, but is definitely fixed. Maybe initiative is sexy to Riot. I sure hope so.  

Lastly, here's a bunch of links for stuff I want to read but I don't want to have a million tabs open for another week so I'm dumping...
