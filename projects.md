### HypePKR  
[HypePKR](https://github.com/Bl00ve/HypePKR) or the Hyper Kinetic Position Reverser is basically a fancy script for moving columns in a Nessus output.  

### Scatter
[Scatter](https://github.com/Bl00ve/Scatter) is a Powershell script built to distribute and run SCAP Compliance Checker with a bunch of checks put in for dummies to use it.  

## Coming Soon  
Currently working on a project to create network vulnerability query strings to pass into a URL for Moloch Packet Analyzer. I started it in Bash, and it just became too sloppy and difficult. So gonna go back with my original idea of doing it in Python.
