I made this site as more of a personal reference tool and a research memoir of sorts. I'm sure this plan will evolve over time, but for now that's the use case. I'll also include some of my other accolades across gaming to include humble bragging about League of Legends rank. As well as, promote some ideas about shoutcasting.
